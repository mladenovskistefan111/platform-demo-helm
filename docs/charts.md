# What each chart provides

| | |
|---|---|
| Workload | `Deployment` (or `StatefulSet` for the two stores), RollingUpdate with `maxUnavailable: 0`, `minReadySeconds`, `revisionHistoryLimit` |
| Scaling | `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` v2 (CPU 70 %, scale-down stabilisation 300 s), replicas owned by the HPA when enabled |
| Availability | `PodDisruptionBudget` (`maxUnavailable: 1`, `AlwaysAllow` for unhealthy pods), soft topology spread, `preStop` sleep, per-service termination grace |
| Probes | startup / readiness / liveness (native `grpc` probes for gRPC services, `httpGet` for the frontend, `exec` for Postgres/Redis) |
| Resources | requests + limits for every container (sized from measured usage) |
| Security | restricted Pod Security profile: non-root numeric UID/GID, read-only root FS with explicit `/tmp`, no privilege escalation, all capabilities dropped, `RuntimeDefault` seccomp, no ServiceAccount token, no service links |
| Network | default-deny with allow-lists: `NetworkPolicy` (any CNI) or, with `networkPolicy.type: cilium`, a `CiliumNetworkPolicy` that also requires **SPIFFE/SPIRE mutual authentication** between workloads (ingress only from the documented callers; egress only to DNS, documented dependencies and Alloy) |
| Config | `env` map (templated with `tpl`), `secretEnv` for credentials, shared `global.monitoring` endpoints, downward-API `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` |
| Telemetry | OTLP/gRPC to Alloy for traces/metrics/logs, Pyroscope push for profiles — no scrape config needed |
| Admission | In the cluster, Kyverno additionally requires: known app name bound to its own ServiceAccount, allowed registries + digest + our cosign signature, read-only root FS, requests/limits, probes, no API token (`policies/README.md`) |
| Hygiene | `app.kubernetes.io/*` labels, `values.schema.json`, `NOTES.txt`, image precedence `digest > tag > appVersion`, `global.imageRegistry` |

Resource names equal the chart names on purpose: they are the DNS names the services are configured with (`cart-service:7070`, …). Install everything into one namespace, or override every `*_ADDR` with an FQDN.
